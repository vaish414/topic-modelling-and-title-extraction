# topic-modelling-and-title-extraction
This project automates title generation and topic modeling for academic texts. It uses TF-IDF for generating contextually relevant titles and LDA for uncovering latent topics. Future work will explore deep learning-based topic modeling with BERTopic for larger datasets.
