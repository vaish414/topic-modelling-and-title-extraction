# topic-modelling-and-title-extraction
This project automates title generation and topic modeling for academic texts. It uses TF-IDF for generating contextually relevant titles and LDA for uncovering latent topics. Future work will explore deep learning-based topic modeling with BERTopic for larger datasets.

## NLP-Driven Title Generation and Topic Modeling
- Project Overview
With the exponential growth of academic publications, efficiently summarizing and organizing research has become essential. This project addresses these challenges through automated title generation and topic modeling for academic texts. The project uses TF-IDF for title generation and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, providing structured insights and concise summaries that improve research accessibility and content discoverability.

- In future work, we aim to extend our approach to include BERTopic, a deep learning-based model for enhanced topic extraction on larger datasets.

## Objectives
Automated Title Generation: Creating concise and informative titles from academic abstracts to capture the essence of the research.
Topic Modeling: Identifying and summarizing key themes within academic texts to enable quick insights into large volumes of literature.
Future Scalability: Addressing the limitations of traditional topic modeling with advanced NLP approaches in future research.

## Methodology
Our approach utilizes two main techniques, each suited for specific tasks within academic text processing.

1. Title Generation with TF-IDF
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical method commonly used in information retrieval to assess the importance of words in a document relative to a corpus. This project applies TF-IDF as the foundation for generating titles, focusing on two main steps:
- Keyword Extraction: For each abstract, the top-ranking terms are identified based on TF-IDF scores. Words with high TF-IDF values indicate terms that are specific and relevant to the document, making them ideal candidates for summarizing content.
- Contextual Refinement: The extracted keywords are analyzed for contextual relationships. Using Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, we ensure that selected terms form coherent, grammatically accurate phrases that encapsulate the core ideas of the abstract.
- Through this process, TF-IDF enables us to produce concise titles that accurately reflect each paper's main focus, enhancing readability and relevance.

2. Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative probabilistic model used for topic modeling, capable of discovering the hidden thematic structure in large text corpora. In our approach, LDA helps us identify and categorize the main themes within academic texts, providing insights into recurring research areas.

## Key steps in the LDA process include:

* Topic Discovery: LDA models each document as a mixture of various topics, with each topic represented by a distribution over words. By examining these distributions, we can infer the central themes across multiple documents.
* Coherence Evaluation: Topic coherence scores are computed to evaluate the interpretability of topics generated by LDA. Higher coherence scores indicate topics that are more semantically meaningful, enhancing their relevance and clarity.
* LDA has been applied to two datasets: a smaller set of research articles and a larger dataset of arXiv papers. While LDA performs well with structured, smaller datasets, challenges arise when applied to large-scale, unstructured datasets, highlighting the need for more scalable methods like deep learning-based approaches.

## Future Work: BERTopic for Deep Topic Modeling
As part of ongoing research, we plan to explore BERTopic, a model that leverages BERT embeddings for context-aware topic extraction. BERTopic combines three powerful techniques:

- BERT Embeddings: Encodes text into high-dimensional embeddings that capture the semantic context.
- UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection): Reduces the dimensionality of embeddings, making them manageable for clustering.
- HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): A clustering technique well-suited for high-dimensional data, enabling more nuanced topic modeling.
- BERTopic holds promise for large datasets, as it can handle complex, unstructured texts and requires less manual parameter tuning. By implementing BERTopic, we aim to overcome the scalability and coherence limitations faced with traditional LDA models on extensive datasets like arXiv papers.

## Insights and Practical Applications
This project presents several key insights:

- Scalability and Limitations of Traditional Methods: While TF-IDF and LDA are effective for title generation and topic modeling, respectively, they face challenges with large and diverse datasets. This reinforces the need for scalable NLP methods for high-dimensional, unstructured text.
- Role of Context in Title Generation: TF-IDF allows for high precision in selecting important terms but lacks contextual depth, which could be addressed by integrating deep learning methods in future implementations.
- Enhanced Topic Modeling with Deep Learning: By leveraging deep learning for topic extraction, we can improve topic coherence, relevance, and interpretability, particularly in extensive corpora with complex themes.

Potential Applications
- Academic Publishing: Automated title generation can streamline the publication process by suggesting relevant, informative titles, improving the discoverability of research.
- Content Management: Libraries and digital archives can use topic modeling to categorize vast collections of research papers, making it easier for readers to find relevant literature.
- SEO and Digital Marketing: Techniques from this project can be applied to generate optimized, keyword-rich titles and categorize content on large content platforms.

## Future Directions
Future research will focus on:

- Implementing BERTopic: We plan to conduct a comparative study of BERTopicâ€™s performance on large datasets like arXiv papers, measuring improvements in coherence and clustering quality over LDA.
Scaling TF-IDF for Large Datasets: Investigating methods to adapt TF-IDF for larger datasets, potentially by incorporating distributed computing or cloud-based processing.
Improving Contextual Relevance: Exploring hybrid methods that combine TF-IDF with BERT embeddings to enhance the semantic relevance of generated titles, particularly in cases where nuanced context is critical.

## Conclusion
This project offers a foundation for automated academic summarization through title generation and topic modeling. By integrating traditional NLP methods like TF-IDF and LDA with theoretical frameworks for deep learning, we provide a robust solution that can improve research accessibility and content organization across various domains. Our work underscores the value of selecting topic modeling techniques that align with dataset characteristics and highlights the potential of future deep learning integration for high-dimensional data applications.
